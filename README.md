<h1> 2025 NBA Free Agency Project <br/><a <h1>
<h4> By: Robert Frank </h4>

<h2> Overview </h2>
In this project, my goal is to build a linear regression model in R that predicts the expected salary for NBA free agents this offseason based on their production during the 2024-2025 NBA season. As a lifelong Chicago Bulls fan and NBA twitter enthusiast, I am extremely invested in the free agent market this summer.

<h2> Step 4: Build Linear Regression Model </h2>
